; HTTP 2.0 server connection class that implements appropriate header
; compression / decompression algorithms and stream management logic.
;
; Your code is responsible for feeding request data to the server object,
; which in turn performs all of the necessary HTTP 2.0 decoding / encoding,
; state management, and the rest. See README.md for an example.
