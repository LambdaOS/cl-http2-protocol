; HTTP 2.0 client connection class that implements appropriate header
; compression / decompression algorithms and stream management logic.
;
; Your code is responsible for driving the client object, which in turn
; performs all of the necessary HTTP 2.0 encoding / decoding, state
; management, and the rest. See README.md for an example.
